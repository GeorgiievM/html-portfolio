<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I’m Martin Georgiev — a creative media designer, videographer, and
  storyteller based in Austria, originally from Macedonia. I specialize in
  crafting powerful visual content that not only looks good but connects
  emotionally and leaves a lasting impact.
</p>

<p>
  Whether it’s through cinematic video production, eye-catching motion graphics,
  or capturing breathtaking aerial footage with my drone, I bring a sharp eye
  for detail and a passion for meaningful storytelling to every project I take
  on. From weddings and branded content to creative social media campaigns — I
  don’t just shoot and edit; I shape moments into experiences.
</p>

<p>
  I’m also diving into the world of web development — currently learning HTML,
  CSS, and JavaScript to bring my creative skills into digital spaces. While I’m
  still at the beginning of this journey, I’m excited to blend design with
  interactivity and build modern, responsive websites.
</p>

<p>
  With a background in graphic design and audiovisual media, plus hands-on
  experience in Adobe Creative Suite, DaVinci Resolve, After Effects, and more,
  I combine technical skill with a human touch. I also hold a certified drone
  license, so I can elevate projects — literally and creatively.
</p>

<p>
  When I’m not behind a camera or coding something new, I’m constantly learning,
  exploring tools, and pushing creative boundaries.
</p>
<p>Let’s bring your vision to life — with style, purpose, and impact.</p>
